In this project, it was implemented a data science solution app.

It consists in a deploy model that can make a fast EDA analysis to your dataset. 

## NOTES:
This solution do not substitute a more deeper analysis of your dataset. Because there is no treatment of the missing values, duplicated values and also problematic information on the columns. The main goal is to give a quicker overview of the contained information inside the dataset.
